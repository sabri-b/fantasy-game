**Exercise 6**

A series of challenges.
Create a single python file or, if you want, make separate files for all the tasks.

# TASKS

## TASK 1

- Create a guessing game!
- Create a random number between 1 and 10
- Using a while loop, ask the user to guess the number until they get it right

**Bonus challenge**
- Create the number between 1 and 100000
- Tell the user if their guess is higher or lower
- Let the player know how many guesses did they need

## TASK 2

- Print out the first 50 numbers of the fibonnacci series
- A classic programming puzzle, common in coding challenges when applying for jobs
- The fibonnacci series is a series of numbers starting with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...
- Each new number is the sum of the previous two numbers
- You can use a `for` loop and the `range` function, but you don't have to :)
